# Rainfall_Prediction_Using_ML
End-to-end machine learning project for rainfall prediction using historical meteorological data. Includes data cleaning, feature engineering, model training and evaluation, making it useful for weather-related planning and demonstrating applied ML skills.

The dataset includes features such as:

- **Humidity**
- **Temperature**
- **Wind speed / pressure**
- **Cloud coverage**
- **Recent rainfall history**
- **Other atmospheric indicators**

These features are **engineered and leveraged** to train supervised models that classify or estimate rainfall intensity.
